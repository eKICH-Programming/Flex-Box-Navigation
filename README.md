# Flex-Box-Navigation

Creating Menu Navigation using flex box is much easier and straight forward compared to use of floats and positions where you have to do math to compute widths and heights. 
Flex box container makes your menu items grow and shrink when the browser window is resized and grow once the browser window is maximized. 
We set flex-nav ul display to flex to make it the flex container while the li items become the flex items allowing us to use flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis on our flex items. 
In these files, we used a shorthand way of writing the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. By use of flex property, which is the shorthand as mentioned. We set the flex-grow and flex-shrik to 1. 

Have fun
